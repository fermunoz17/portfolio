            text: "This project measures how much individual news articles deviate from a consensus 'ground truth' across multiple sources. Using NewsAPI for article aggregation and newspaper3k for text extraction, each article was transformed into semantic vector embeddings via the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. Named entity recognition was used to identify common facts across articles, which formed the baseline for comparison. Cosine similarity was applied to determine deviation scores, highlighting outlier articles that may present bias or misinformation. The project emphasizes NLP, semantic analysis, and information reliability in media coverage.",
